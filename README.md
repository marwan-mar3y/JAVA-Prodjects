# Java Projects

Welcome to my repository showcasing various Java projects. This collection features different applications built using Java, demonstrating my skills in software development, object-oriented programming (OOP), and problem-solving. The projects cover a wide range of topics, from user authentication and data management to real-world simulations such as banking systems, e-commerce platforms, and more.

## About This Repository

This repository contains a variety of projects developed using Java, each focusing on different aspects of programming. These projects were created to improve my understanding of core concepts such as:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- File Handling and Data Persistence
- User Input Handling
- Basic Networking and Multi-threading (in some projects)

The projects included here showcase practical implementations of common software patterns, and they can serve as a reference for anyone looking to learn Java or understand how to solve specific problems with code.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language for all projects.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, HashMaps, and other data structures.
- **User Input Handling**: Using `Scanner` for dynamic user input.
- **File Handling**: Storing and retrieving data in files (where applicable).
- **Basic Networking**: Some projects include basic networking concepts and multi-threading.
