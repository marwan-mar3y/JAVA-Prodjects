# College System - Data Structures Implementation

This is a simple college system program written in Java, using basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and custom node classes to simulate the enrollment process of students in courses. The program allows for the following functionalities:

- Input of course details (course name, course ID).
- Input of student details (student name, student ID).
- Assignment of courses to students.
- Display of students enrolled in each course.
- Display of courses enrolled by each student.

## Features

- **Course Management**: Allows for the creation of multiple courses with a course name and unique ID.
- **Student Management**: Allows for the creation of student records with a name and student ID.
- **Enrollment**: Students can be enrolled in courses interactively by choosing which courses they want to join.
- **Linked List Structure**: Students and courses are managed using custom linked list implementations.
- **Enrollment Reports**: The program can display which students are enrolled in each course, and which courses a student is enrolled in.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language used.
- **Linked Lists**: Used to store and manage students and courses dynamically.
- **Scanner**: Used to handle user input for dynamic interaction.

## Requirements

- JDK 8 or higher.
